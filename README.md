# ImprovedGAN-Tensorflow

This is a Tensorflow implementation of semi-supervised learning GAN proposed in the paper Improved Techniques
for Training GANs from Salimans et al.
The code reproduces the numbers presented in the original paper. It uses exactly the same tricks which are used in the original implementation and gives better
performance than other reproductions available online.
